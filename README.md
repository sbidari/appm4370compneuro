# appm4370compneuro
Python code and jupyter notebooks for APPM 4370/5370: Computational Neuroscience, Spring 2020

All of this code is meant to accompany the course, and you are welcome to use/extend it to solve problems on homework. Each piece of python code has an accompanying jupyter notebook which explains the purpose in more detail.

There are a couple ways to download files. First, you could just download all of them by clicking "Clone or download" [green button] and then "Download ZIP." Alternatively, you can download individual files by clicking on a file, cliking the "Raw" button, and saving the file (make sure to remove the ".txt" suffix your web browser may add). It's probably best to save files for this course in a common folder in your computer. Then to open the python or jupyter notebook on your own computer, open Spyder or Jupyter in Anaconda and open. You can also simply copy/paste code snippets into your local python text editor.
